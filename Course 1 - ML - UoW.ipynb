that he is appropriately sensitive to the facts of the person before him and the rights of victims of the crimes that have been committed indeed it is our understanding that the government has never filed an appeal from judge chatignys sentencings and that there has only been one defendant who has appealed from an upward departure we are of the strong opinion that judge chatignys record on the bench makes him an outstanding and very qualified candidate seventeen former federal prosecutors who have worked with judge chatigny wrote to the senate judiciary committee that in criminal as well as civil matters judge chatigny has proven himself over the course of 15 years on the bench to be unbiased compassionate and temperatein its 2006 dismissal of charges in the ross case the second circuit judicial council found that judge chatignys actions were not motivated by any bias in favor of ross the prisoner or against the death penalty but only by the judges reasonable perception that the discharge of his own judicial dutyrequired that he take forceful steps on rosss behalf while the judge used strong language there was no misconductin the judges reasonable view the circumstances thrust on him called for unusual action in discharge of judicial duty to ensure the fair resolution of the important proceeding before himchatigny has yet to rule on the appeal of former yale professor james van de velde who had sued the city of new haven in 2001 then yale in 2003 for allowing his name to be leaked at the inception of the investigation into the death of yale student suzanne jovin in december 1998 chatigny dismissed the federal fourth amendment claims in march 2004 but left alone the state claims relating to the ruination of van de veldes career by not allowing the case to proceed van de velde claims his efforts to shed light on the cold case and pressure the authorities try to solve the case have been stonewalledof the 440some opinions judge chatigny has

from different backgrounds while strauss like his grandfather martin buber was submersed in the german tradition and his important writings are in german and hebrew toulmin a pupil of ludwig wittgenstein grew up within the english analytic traditionthe philosophers whose writings have made the greatest impact upon benzeev are aristotle baruch spinoza and immanuel kant kants main influence is most evident in ben zeevs discussions on epistemology and perception aristotles and spinozas impact is more apparent in his discussions of the mindbody problem and in his work on the emotionsbenzeevs major books are the perceptual system peter lang 1993 the subtlety of emotions mit up 2000 love online emotions on the internet cambridge up 2004 in the name of love romantic ideology and its victims with ruhama goussinsky oxford up 2008 die logik der gefhle kritik der emotionalen intelligenz suhrkamp 2009benzeev has held several academic positions at the university of haifa including president 20042012 rector 20002004 dean of research 19952000 philosophy department chairperson 19861988 chairperson of the humanity division oranimschool of education 19911994 chairperson of the association of university heads israel head of the university of haifa press and head of the academic channel he established the interdisciplinary center for the study of emotions at the university of haifa he is currently the president of the newly established european philosophical society for the study of emotionsphilosophical viewexplanatory toolsthe choice of conceptual tools determines the nature of our explanations in light of the complexity of psychological phenomena the tools that we use to explain them should be flexible enough to accommodate the complexity of reality three such tools which are evident throughout benzeevs writings are the distinctions between various levels of description prototypical and binary categories and intrinsically and extrinsically valuable activities the distinction between various levels of description reflects his stratification approach concerning the bodymind problem this approach has three basic assumptions a the mind consists of dispositional and actualized states and not of internal isolated entities b physiological and mental states are not actually separate but belong to two different levels of descriptionthe relationship between them is one of stratification rather than of causality and c mental and physical states emerge along a continuum that ranges from simple to more complex states this approach is close to aristotle spinoza and the advocates of the emergent view of mental properties this issue is discussed in detail in his book on perception benzeev further believes that prototypical categories which have no clearcut boundaries and no equal degree of membership are generally more appropriate to the psychological realm and hence clearcut definitions of emotions are of little value and general characterizations should be given preference furthermore we should expect many grey areas when discussing human activities benzeev emphasizes the importance of intrinsically valuable activities for longterm happiness and profound love the combination of all three distinctions is significant in explaining psychological and in particular emotional phenomena despite his use of complex conceptual tools on many issues benzeev remains close to a critical yet commonsense viewperceptionin his various writings on perception in particular the perceptual system benzeev rejects the indirect view of perception and argues for the presence of direct nonpure perception he rejects nave realism as well as extreme subjectivism and argues for a critical realism such realism considers perceptual qualities as properties of the perceptual environment which is a relational environment that presupposes the existence of a perceiver within the perceptual environment perception is direct as it involves direct awareness of events in the environment but in light of the relational nature of this environment perceptual awareness merely provides partial information about the worldthat part which is influenced by the subjects characteristics in his view perception is direct in two major senses it is perception of the objects themselves not of internal mental representations and it is not preceded by mediating inferential processes benzeevs book the perceptual system received an excellent review in the review of metaphysics with the reviewer jack ornstein stating that benzeevs view is the only remotely plausible approach to the mindbody problem finally we have a theory of perception and the mind which any scientificallyminded critical philosopher can live with together with his work on perception benzeev has pursued related issues in the philosophy of psychology such as the bodymind problem and memory and has written on various philosophers in particular aristotle and thomas reidemotionsfive years after finishing his phd thesis benzeev began to study the emotions a topic that remains at the center of his research today in this field he was particularly influenced by aristotle mainly his analysis of emotions as evaluative attitudes and by spinoza in particular his emphasis on the importance of change in generating emotions the psychological work that has most influenced his thinking has been the cognitive structure of emotions 1988 by ortony clore and collins benzeev has published many articles in this field as well as several books the subtlety of emotions mit 2000 love online emotions on the internet cambridge 2004 in the name of love romantic ideology and its victims oxford 2008 written with ruhama goussinsky and die logik der gefhle kritik der emotionalen intelligenz suhrkamp 2009the subtlety of emotions his major work on emotions is divided into two major parts the first presents an overall conceptual framework for understanding emotions and the second discusses individual emotions he considers emotion to be a general mode of the mental system and suggests that the typical cause of emotions is a perceived change the typical emotional concern is a comparative concern and the typical emotional object is a human being typical emotions are considered to have certain basic characteristicsinstability great intensity a partial perspective and relative brevityand four basic componentscognition evaluation motivation and feeling emotions are regarded as having a significant practical and moral valueromantic loveromantic love has been the major emotion discussed by benzeev in his book love online he demonstrates the value of his conceptual framework for understanding emotions on the internet and in particular romantic relationships in cyberspace no new emotion has been created on the internet but the generation of emotions is often differentfor example in the speed at which such emotions are generated he argues that the chaotic and dynamic nature of cyberspace will not replace the more stable nature of actualspace as we cannot live in complete chaos the test of the internet will be whether it can complement ordinary romantic activities just as the telephone complements ordinary social activities or whether it will merely replace them with less valuable activities as the television frequently doesthe book in the name of love is about our ideals of love as expressed in the romantic ideology our experiences of love and the disparity between the two this ideology which assumes that love is comprehensive uncompromising and unconditional may lead to extreme behavior such as is found in men who murder their wives or partners allegedly out of love although romantic ideology may have a negative impact on many people in different circumstances it still has the positive function of a guiding ideal at the basis of ben zeevs proposed nurturing approach lies the assumption that in order for romantic love to be maintained the lover should not merely ensure that the beloved feels good it is imperative too that the lover is profoundly satisfied with the way in which the relationship enhances her own development and flourishing only a profoundly satisfied person can enhance the flourishing of the other and of their togetherness in many current societies love is on the mind of an evergreater number of people and its presence is a major criterion for relationships love can no longer be dismissed as a silly fantasy it is perceived as realistic and feasible for an increasing number of peoplein recent years benzeevs research has been focused on romantic compromises and related issues such as the profundity of love the relationship between love and sex and love and time in romantic compromises people relinquish a romantic value such as romantic freedom or intense sexual desire in exchange for a nonromantic value like the wish to live comfortably he considers such compromises to be the most common and painful syndrome in intimate relationships nevertheless he argues for the existence of good romantic compromises where there is a value convergence between the two lovers and the lovers minds are at rest as their togetherness has an intrinsic value', 'aaron bertram born april 3 1981 in lubbock texas is a trumpet player for third wave ska band suburban legends and member of

You will save them soo many headaches Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!\", \"When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn't have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier  This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item  The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes  I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit \", \"Lovely book, it's bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book  Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29 95!\", \"Perfect for new parents  We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life  Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!\", 'A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!', \"This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I'm not at home   Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you're not home The only reason this isn't a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal \", \"I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter's sleep, eating and other activities  The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i e  we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc ) I love knowing the details of my baby's day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i e  baby's nap time has moved naturally as she gets older) My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny's comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i e  Baby didn't sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it's hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning  I just stick in post-its now for my notes  All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker \", \"This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep   Definitely would recommend this for new moms   Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits \", \"I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one  She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes  I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information  This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted  There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out  It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info  Each page goes from 7 - 6  This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm  I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby  I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone  My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided  Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format  This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal  7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation \", \"I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice   But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1 ) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained   If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me   (I don't nurse in the same place every time )2 ) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on   I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button 3 ) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect)   It gives me better data   For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training)   It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction) \", 'Space for monthly photos, info and a lot of useful stickers come with it  It is exactly what I wanted!!', 'I bought this calender for myself for my second son  It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do  There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed  The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing  My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day  I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well ', \"I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby's firsts  I like the illustrations, and the stickers too \", 'This was the only calender I could find for the second year  I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1  This one was better than the first year one I got him ', \"I completed a calendar for my son's first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he's still doing amazing and fun things every day   I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it's something to keep recording all those special moments!\", \"We wanted to get something to keep track of our child's milestones and this is a cute option  There aren't many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted \", \"I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month's picture in as well as some memories  The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones   and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book   This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!\", \"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter  I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones  It's an okay calendar  The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens  The stickers aren't very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking  Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers \", \"I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my son's second year of life   There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didn't want to just stop now that he is one   Nature's lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping   The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own   I highly recommend this calendar!  Plus it's super cute and brat for either gender \", 'Calendar is exactly as described, but I find the look of it to be very cheap   There are lots of nice stickers to use   I was just disappointed it looks so cheap ', 'Wife loves this calender  Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts  Includes spaces for milestone photos as well  Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option  Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies', 'My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago  She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar  When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones  Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it  Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill  A nice keepsake  A wonderful gift for a one-year old!', 'Extremely useful! As a new mom, tired and inexpedient, not remembering how long ago baby ate, this definitely helped me through the first two months ', \"My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect! This book doesn't engage him enough though it seems   He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blow-kisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him  He also likes when I fan the hair towards his face Maybe when he's older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover  If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around \", \"One of baby's first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I'd like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)\", 'I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat - it wont get lost   Great way to go over family members ', 'Beautiful little book   A great little short story saying I Love You    Keeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it ', \"This book is so worth the money  It says 9+ months on the box but I can't wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before  It's so cute and very interactive! There are flaps to open on every page \", 'we just got this book for our one-year-old and she loves it   It\\'s so nice that she can\\'t bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one   She can chew on it, pull on it, and carry it all over the house!  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like \"daddy,\" \"mommy,\" \"puppy,\" etc   We love it ', \"The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older  The only thing I didn't like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material  I dunked the pages in detergent  Then let the book dry overnight \", 'The book is cute, and we are huge fans of Lamaze products, however, this one leaves out some family members (no little brother) and can possibly cause hurt feelings  That said, our baby loves to play with the hands, hair and flaps!', \"What a great book for babies!  I'd been looking for books which couldn't be damaged by my 10-month old's drool   so cloth or plastic books were my options   This book adds another level to your usual cloth book--a fun flap or moving part on every page   This interactive book is perfect for my baby!\", \"My son loved this book as an infant   It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them, but this one we didn't have that issue   I love the Lamaze series, they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parent I liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo, but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents, sister, cat, dog etc   And of course with it being a lift the flap book, that was additional fun for my son as well   He's nearly two now and he doesn't look at it as much, but he still does enjoy reading it and playing with it now and again   I'd say out of all the Lamaze books, this one and Discovery Farm are his favorites \", 'Our baby loves this book & has loved it for a while now     He enjoys when I read it to him, and enjoys playing with it on his own ', '', \"My son likes brushing elmo's teeth  Almost too nice of a book to let the kids play with haha :)\", 'This was a birthday present for my 2 year old grandchildren   They love this book and will sit and go through it page by page themselves    The pictures are imaginative and appeal to young children   Would buy it again!', \"This bear is absolutely adorable and I would give it a 5 star rating if it actually giggled or growled like it was suppose to!  I just got it in the mail the other day and was super excited when I saw how cute it was!  If it's something as simple as a dead battery I could handle it BUT I can't even find a place where the batteries would to!  Such a disappointment    it's going back and I have no gift to take down to my new Granddaughter, Kenzie, now!\", 'My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her   I\\'m happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and \"reads\" it all of the time  While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too  Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is \"Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo\" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price) ', \"I bought two for recent baby showers!  The book is soft and interactive, great for any baby, and the bright colors are beautiful   Lastly, who doesn't love Elmo!\", 'We wanted to get another book like the Big Birds Friends softplay book, and we only found the two Elmo books  This one is fun, but the Big Bird book has more variety and is more creative ', \"This is a cute little peek-a-boo story book   It's soft   It's safe   And it is easy for baby to handle \", 'My 3 month old son loves this book  We read it over and over and he smiles and laughs every time we find Elmo and say &#34;peekaboo Elmo!&#34;  We have a few different soft books and this is the most colorful and fun to read  And baby adores it, so 5 stars for sure ', 'Very cute interactive book!
